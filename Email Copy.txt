Hello!


My name is [NAME] and I am part of the live coding collective LiveCode.NYC https://www.facebook.com/livecodenyc We are currently looking for a venue for an upcoming Algorave in [MONTH]. Our date is flexible.


Algoraves are experiment music nights where music is made though coding live. It is an international movement and more can be found at https://algorave.com/ LiveCode.NYC has produced several events across the city now, including several Algoraves at venues such as Sunnyvale, Babycastles and Brooklyn Bizarre. Here is video of one of our previous events https://vimeo.com/245282538.


Our set up is usually just two projectors, a PA and a table. Performers plug in and play through laptops only. Our audience is usually around 50 people. We are open to playing week nights or weekends, really whatever is available.


Thanks for your time!
